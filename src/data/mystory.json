    "story" : "Hello, I am Anish, a Computer Science graduate student from University of Southern California. After completing my undergrad in Computer Engineering from University of Mumbai, I moved to Los Angeles in 2019 for pursuing my Masters. I grew up in a city called Thane, near the thriving metropolis of Mumbai. After spending about 21 years of my life being pampered by my parents and family, I have moved about 9000 miles from my home, to better myself, build my career, meet different people, make new friends, and simply, have an adventure. Of course, my desire to learn more advanced concepts of computer science and the idea of experiencing the American hustle, and working towards the American dream helped my decision to pursue Masters from the United States. \nI used to do gymnastics as a kid, and that habit, nay routine, has been translated to my affinity towards working out, calisthenics and cycling. Working out at least half an hour daily helps me focus and contrary to the popular belief, get energized for the day ahead. Other things I enjoy are playing cricket, going on long walks, petting dogs, and obviously, video games like The Witcher and CS: GO. And yes, moving away from my home made me realize yet another thing I love, cooking! Ah, I know, I’ve written too many pastimes which are not all possible in a day due to the on-going grind of life, so I try to switch these enjoyments accordingly when I am not fixated to my computer coding. Since childhood I thought I was a geek who was just good with computers and tweaking stuff, but since college I’ve learned that there is so much depth to a personality, just like the skill tree of your RPG video game character...ah, here goes the geek stuff again! Two things I’ve learned through the years is that I have got so much to learn, and being kind always pays off. Thus, I try to live by my quote,",
